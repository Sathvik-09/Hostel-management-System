“HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is software developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few years, the number of educational institutions is increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels is also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who are running the hostel, so that the valuable data/information of students can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.
The project is designed so as to be used by Admin to add students in the hostel. It is an onlinesystem through which Admin can add students to hostel, view available hostels, add the newhostel, view students, view number of students, search student, see the room allotments and add warden .
